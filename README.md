# Small Business Environment Project
## In this project I worked together with a team to build a small business environment using GNS3 via FortiClient VPN.

### Our team setup the client's network to include a LAN, Guest, and DMZ network (these networks were built on a FortiNet firewall (a FortiGate)).
1. Added a FortiNet firewall.
2. Added two Ethernet switches.
3. Added a Win10 workstation.
